# Level 3

We are given with a task to `Exploit an authentication bypass vulnerability`ðŸ”“

As always we are given with an machine and source code of the application.

```python
def level3():
    db.execute(("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users AS "
                'SELECT "flag" AS username, ? as password'),
               (flag,))

    if request.method == "POST":
        username = request.form.get("username")
        password = request.form.get("password")
        assert username, "Missing `username` form"
        assert password, "Missing `password` form"

        user = db.execute(f"SELECT rowid, * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, password)).fetchone()
        assert user, "Invalid `username` or `password`"

        return redirect(request.path, user=int(user["rowid"]))

    if "user" in request.args:
        user_id = int(request.args["user"])
        user = db.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE rowid = ?", (user_id,)).fetchone()
        if user:
            username = user["username"]
            if username == "flag":
                return f"{flag}\n"
            return f"Hello, {username}!\n"

    return form(["username", "password"])

```

So, we can see that the application is using database and we can see that the `username` and `password` are passed as `POST` parameters.
It checks the given username and password if user doesnt exists it asserts the error and if user exists it redirects to the same page with `user` parameter in the url.

So, we can see that the `user` parameter is not sanitized and we can use this to bypass the authentication.
we can pass integer values directly into the `user` parameter and it will return the username of the user with that id.

lets try to pass `user=1` in the url and we get the username of the user with id 1.

```bash
hacker@web-security-level-3:~$ curl http://challenge.localhost/?user=1
pwn.college{cmVL1XdbMpOFvsi5Xc3_sR9xEZ9.dlDOzMDL0IzMyMzW}
```
It reveals the flag ðŸš©.
