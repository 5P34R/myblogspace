## About me

I'm just your friendly neighborhood Computer Science enthusiast from the mesmerizing land of Kerala! 🌴🌊 When I'm not lost in lines of code, I enjoy playing around with web technology and security like a curious kid in a candy store. 💻🔒 Think of me as a crazy tech wizard who's constantly learning and exploring the vast realms of the universe. Oh, and I dabble in CTFs too! 🕵️‍♂️🔐 By the way, if you're ever lost in the matrix, I'll be the first to admit that I'm still figuring my way out too! 😅
